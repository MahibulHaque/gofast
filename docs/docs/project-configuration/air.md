### Air - Server Live Reloading Utility

[Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) is a live-reloading utility designed to enhance the development experience by automatically rebuilding and restarting your Go application whenever changes are detected in the source code.

The Makefile provided in the project repository includes a command make watch, which triggers Air to monitor file changes and initiate rebuilds and restarts as necessary. Additionally, if Air is not installed on your machine, the Makefile provides an option to install it automatically.

Air's `.air.toml` configuration file allows customization of various aspects of its behavior.


### Live Preview

Integrating Air into your development workflow alongside the provided Makefile enables a smooth and efficient process for building, testing, and running your Go applications. With automatic live-reloading, you can focus more on coding and less on manual build and restart steps.
